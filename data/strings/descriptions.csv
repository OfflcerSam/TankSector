j_fr_contractor,SHIP,"Developed by Eirin-Sahl Dynamics, the ESD–EF48 Contractor II, affectionately nicknamed Deadline, is the backbone escort frigate of the EFF (Eterra Federated Fleet). Engineered with Eirin-Sahl’s hallmark spatial optimization, the Contractor II packs an outsized arsenal and multirole capability into a dense, modular frame—serving equally well in scout, pursuit, and escort roles.

Its signature design philosophy—function over comfort—has earned it a reputation as both indispensable and borderline inhumane among long-term crews. The Deadline earns its name through relentless deployment cycles and a tendency to be first on-scene and last to dock. The EF48 fills the gap, holds the line, and stays on schedule.

“Every time I open one up, I find something else that shouldn't fit—and somehow still does. It's a miracle of design and a nightmare to maintain. Beautiful, terrible work.”
— Dockmaster Sella Trann, Eirin-Sahl Dynamics",,,
